# Front-End Nodes

Typically in systems built with Akka, clients submit requests using a RESTful API. Either [Akka HTTP](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/introduction.html) or [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com) are great choices for implementing an HTTP API for the front-end. To limit the scope of this example, we have chosen to emulate client activity with two ordinary actors:

* The `FrontEnd` actor generates payloads at random intervals and sends them to the 'Master' actor.
* The `WorkResultConsumerActor` that consumes results and logs them.


The `FrontEnd` actor only concerns itself with posting workloads, and does not care when the work has been completed. When a workload has been processed successfully and passed to the `Master` actor it publishes the result to all interested cluster nodes through Distributed Pub-Sub. 

The `WorkResultConsumerActor` subscribes to the completion events and logs when a workload has completed.

Now, let's take a look at the code that accomplishes this front-end behavior.

## The Front-end Actor

@@snip [FrontEnd.scala]($g8src$/scala/worker/FrontEnd.scala) { #front-end }

Note in the source code that as the 'FrontEnd' actor starts up, it:

1. Schedules 'Tick' messages to itself.
1. Each 'Tick' message:
   1. Triggers creation of a new 'Work' message.
   1. Sends the 'Work' message to the 'Master' actor of a 'back-end' node.
   1. Switches to a new 'busy' behavior.

As you can see the `FrontEnd` actor schedules `Tick` messages to itself when starting up. the `Tick` message then triggers creation of a new `Work`, sending the work to the `Master` actor on a `back-end` node and switching to a new `busy` behavior.

The cluster contains one `Master` actor. The `FrontEnd` actor does not need to know the exact location because it sends work to the master using the `ClusterSingletonProxy`.

The 'Master' actor can accept or deny a work request and we need to deal with unexpected errors:

* If the 'Master' accepts the request, the actor schedules a new tick to itself and toggles back to the idle behavior.
* To deal with failures, the message uses the [ask pattern](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/actors.html#ask-send-and-receive-future) to add a timeout to wait for a reply. If the timeout expires before the master responds, the returned 'Future' fails with an akka.pattern.AskTimeoutException.
* We transform timeouts or denials from the 'Master' into a 'NotOK' value. The 'Future' is piped to the 'FrontEnd' actor as a message with the completed value, either the successful result, or 'NotOK'. If the work is not accepted or there is no response, for example if the message or response got lost, the FrontEnd actor backs off a bit and then sends the work again.


The future is then `pipe`d to the actor itself, meaning that when it completes the value it is completed with is sent to the actor as a message.

When a workload has been acknowledged by the master, the actor schedules a new tick to itself and toggles back to the `idle` behavior.  

If the work is not accepted or there is no response, for example if the message or response got lost, the `FrontEnd` actor backs off a bit and then sends the work again.

You can see the how the actors on a front-end node is started in the method `Main.startFrontEnd`:

@@snip [Main.scala]($g8src$/scala/worker/Main.scala) { #front-end }

## The Work Result Consumer Actor
As mentioned in the introduction, results are published using Distributed Pub-Sub. The 'WorkResultConsumerActor' subscribes to completion events and logs when a workload has completed:

@@snip [Main.scala]($g8src$/scala/worker/WorkResultConsumer.scala) { #work-result-consumer }

In an actual application you would probably want a way for clients to poll or stream the status changes of the submitted work.
